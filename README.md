Following along with Kent Beck's **Test-Driven Development: By Example**.

## To-do List

  - ~~Invoke the test method~~
  - ~~Invoke setUp first~~
  - ~~Invoke tearDown afterward~~
  - ~~Invoke tearDown even if the test method fails~~
  - ~~Run multiple tests~~
  - ~~Report collected results~~
  - ~~Log string in WasRun~~
  - ~~Report failed tests~~
  - ~~Catch and report setUp errors~~
  - ~~Create TestSuite from a TestCase class~~
  - ~~Implement the Test interface~~
  - ~~Test assert methods~~
  - Report the name of the TestSuite
  - Report which Tests failed
  - Report the stack trace of failing tests
  - ~~Create a test runner (e.g.: node app [directory])~~
  - ~~Import TestCases from a module path~~
  - ~~Resolve a module path relative to the working directory of the Node process~~
  - ~~Run discovered TestCases from a module~~
  - ~~Run all dicovered TestCases from a directory~~
  - Display command-line usage when run with --help or incorrect arguments
  - Run tests in parallel
  - Run tests in random order
  - Use asynchronous methods to discover tests
